## GitHub

Repository: `Twlv20-AI/twlv20-ai-skills`

- Visibility: private.
- Default branch: `main`.
- Latest verified GitHub Actions:
  - CI: success.
  - Deploy: success.
- Runtime service deployed from commit `ce5180a` during the previous deploy verification.

Known blocker: branch protection could not be enabled for a private repo on the current GitHub plan. GitHub returned HTTP 403 requiring GitHub Pro or public visibility.

## Droplet hardening

Host: `twlv20-prod` / `162.243.252.92`

Verified effective SSH settings:

- `permitrootlogin no`
- `passwordauthentication no`
- `pubkeyauthentication yes`
- `kbdinteractiveauthentication no`
- `AllowUsers keeper jon twlv20-deploy`

Verified UFW:

- active
- default incoming deny
- default outgoing allow
- `22/tcp` limit
- `80/tcp` allow
- `443/tcp` allow

Verified services active:

- `ssh`
- `caddy`
- `fail2ban`
- `ufw`
- `unattended-upgrades`
- `postgresql@16-main`
- `redis-server`
- `docker`
- `twlv20-ai-runtime.service`

Verified fail2ban jails:

- `sshd`
- `caddy-status`

Verified Caddy local response:

```text
twlv20-prod Caddy online. Public host routing pending DNS/domain confirmation.
```

## Postgres + RLS

Verified production DB `twlv20`:

- tenant count: `4`
- extensions present: `pgcrypto`, `vector`
- prior RLS isolation test passed and is documented in the ClickUp audit.

## Backups

Verified systemd timer:

```text
NEXT                          LEFT LAST PASSED UNIT                         ACTIVATES
Sun 2026-05-17 02:00:00 UTC 5 days -         - twlv20-postgres-backup.timer twlv20-postgres-backup.service
```

Verified latest manual backup log includes successful upload:

```text
postgres/weekly/2026-05-11/weekly-postgres-2026-05-11-2336UTC.sql.gz.gpg
```

Prior restore drill succeeded: download → decrypt → restore to throwaway DB → verify → drop throwaway DB.

## Infisical

Verified local-only Infisical status:

```json
{"message":"Ok","emailConfigured":false,"inviteOnlySignup":true,"redisConfigured":true}
```

Verified `infisical-backend` container is running.

Known blockers:

- Public `infisical.<domain>` route needs DNS/domain confirmation.
- SMTP is not configured.
- First admin signup, projects, machine identities, and cross-tenant secret checks remain pending.
- Offline backup/custody of `/etc/infisical/.env` / `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be confirmed before real secrets are migrated.

## Remaining work

1. Confirm real domain/DNS records pointing at `162.243.252.92` for public Caddy routes.
2. Complete Infisical first-admin setup.
3. Create Infisical projects and machine identities.
4. Back up Infisical encryption key offline.
5. Migrate real secrets only after the key backup and project/identity checks.
6. Rotate/clean up exposed legacy credentials now that root SSH is disabled.
7. Resolve GitHub branch protection limitation via GitHub plan upgrade or policy decision.
